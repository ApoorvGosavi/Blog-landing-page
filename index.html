            <p>
                While progressive web apps (PWAs) aren't new, their latest iteration will replace web apps for good. PWAs help websites load in no time and work offline in apps like Google Maps. Companies including Starbucks, Uber, Pinterest, and Twitter use PWAs for an improved user experience — and in 2024, many more organizations have already caught on.
                In the last quarter of 2023, over 58% of International web traffic was from mobile — not including tablets. With the increased usage of smartphones and tablets to perform various online tasks, it has never been more essential to revamp web applications into PWAs.

In addition to providing unmatched user experience, PWAs offer additional benefits such as reduced website development costs and seamless maintenance for the provider. Plus, they visually look and act like a regular web page.

             <p>
                According to our AI trends report, 62% of business leaders have already invested in AI solutions for their staff. In fact, of those executives, 71% are expecting a positive return on investment.

                In 2024, AI chatbots will become even more sophisticated to meet users' needs. To achieve this, bots will more efficiently match user behavior by leveraging machine learning, natural language processing, and information retrieval techniques.
     </p>Besides assisting companies in performing faster operations using voice or text chats, AI-enabled chatbots also help improve customer experience. You can use an AI chatbot to collect data, answer frequently asked questions, and solve other issues. The result is a seamless digital experience for customers to enjoy.

     So, you can see why AI will be more integrated into businesses in 2024. Alternatively, you can use AI tools like GitHub Copilot to write and review your website's code.
